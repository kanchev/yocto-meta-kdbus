Yocto meta layer that adds kernel D-Bus support to the core and kernel recipies.

Warning:
  It has only been tested on beagleboard machine with yocto 1.2!

Usage:
  * Download and extract http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-1.2/poky-denzil-7.0.tar.bz2
  * Setup build environment:
    $ source poky-denzil-7.0/oe-init-build-env build-kdbus
  * Copy beagleboard test config:
    $ cp ../yocto-meta-kdbus/test/beagleboard/local.conf conf
  * Edit and add the absolute path to the yocto-meta-kdbus in conf/bblayers.conf
  * Create a minimal yocto image:
    $ bitbake core-image-minimal

BeagleBoard:
  There is a performance regression when building the u-boot loader from source. For this reason
  a binary image for the Beagleboard C4 from http://code.google.com/p/beagleboard/ is included.

  You can easily verify a running beagleboard system by doing 'cat /proc/cpuinfo'. The value of
  BogoMIPS should be around 700 and not 480!
